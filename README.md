This was home work for a coding bootcamp to write function for some unit testing.

# Pet Shop
For your weekend homework your task is to write some functions to be used in a pet shop.

We have provided some tests for you. Your job is simply to make those tests pass! Work on one at a time, and when you're ready to move on, unskip the next test, watch it fail, then make it pass. Do not modify the code in the tests.

To run the tests:

```bash
python3 run_tests.py
```

To unskip a test delete the following line in the pet_shop_test.py file:

```
@unittest.skip("delete this line to run the test")
